# SQL-Interview-Prep-Question
This repository is for everyone who is preparing for Data Scientist/Data Analyst position interviews. 

This effort of mine is a compilation of all the SQL interview questions which I came across through many interviews and also some are frequently asked questions from various sources. Questions shared are from Facebook, Visa, Wayfair, and couple of startups I have interviewed with. These are MySQL queries and I have tested all the queries for its correctness before pushing it in here. 

Please let me know if you have any other way of writing any piece of queries. Your inputs would be greatly appreciated.
